# VehicleJoystick_stm32_HAL

During playing with bluetooth module i decided to refresh toy car from 20 years ago. It is my first project that i programmed/drew and built. It took me for sure too much time so i am writing this readme to close this chapter and move forward.

I programmed it using HAL library by STM32.

Modules that i used :

- STM32F103C6T6 blue pill clone
- HC-05 bluetooth module for sending data
- Analog thumb joystick to control speed and direction
- Buttons to control motor/lights/reset  
Other stuff that i used:
- 9V Batter
- LED
- LD1117AV33

I built vehicle controller that you can find here : https://github.com/Roju667/VehicleControls_stm32_HAL

I made this abomination without any plan/experience - but it works! So it is perfect to me.
